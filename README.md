# savethesharks

Save Bl√•sharks (or savethesharks) is a project developed in html, css, and javascript (p5.js library) to make people aware of the actions that endanger sharks
and the oceans stability. 
It consists of a menu to explain the three major problems that sharks face due to humans and a game to understand how sharks are affected by these actions.
At the end of the game is a explanation of what can be done to support the cause, as well as the resources used to develop this project.
